# go-ffmpeg-rtsp-to-mp4

This app i created because i just bought TOPO Security Camera and they doesnt support recoding to spesific storage/cloud, so i made this app to achive what i need.

So basically this app does:
- Colult Stream Multiple cameera via RTSP with FFMPEG to .mp4
- Delete recorded camera videos with retention time, configurable in config.yaml.

Need help?
